    //to be completely honest, I did not know how to solve this one. I wanted to make a great test in which it doesn't matter which number you test, it would be able to work. Having said that, most of the manuals/help/tips provide very advanced guidance. I was not able to find examples appropiate for my skill level and for even numbers particularly.
